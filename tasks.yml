Question1:
  background: Variables are very useful in Matlab. They hold values that can be passed as arguments in functions
  question: Define a variable "a" with the value "1"
  type: string
  evaluation: [a=1, a = 1, a =1, a= 1]
  preeval: []
  posteval: [clear('a')]
Question2:
  background: More about variables
  question: Ready for a challenge? Define "b" equal to "1"!
  type: evaluation
  evaluation: ['exist(''b'',''var'')', b==1]
  preeval: []
  posteval: [clear('b')]
Question3:
  background: Testing if the YAML conversion works properly
  question: What do you think? Will it work?
  type: string
  evaluation: ['yes','yes!','definitely!!']
  preeval: []
