Question_statements:
  background: |
    Statements have the form:
    >> variable = expression
    Equality "=" implies the assignment of the expression to the variable. The command prompt
    is represented by two right arrows ">>"
    The assignment of value 1 to the variable a is executed after the enter key is pressed.
    >> a = 1
    You can observe that after the assignment, the value that is stored in the variable is printed
    on the screen. Printing all the values of all the variables can affect a lot the speed of
    execution of your program. To suppress the output of any assignment or result, use the semicolon (;)
    in a statement
    >> a = 1; #Does not print any result. Now try it yourself.
  question: Define a variable 'a' with the value '56'
  type: commands
  preeval: [clear('a')]
  evaluation: ['exist(''a'',''var'')', 'a==56']
  posteval: [clear('a')]
Question_row_vector:
  background: |
    In MATLAB (and in mathematics in general) there is a difference between a row (line) and a column vector.
    It is very important to define the correct type of vector each time, because calculations can
    be wrong otherwise. To define a vector, we use the square brackets '[' (to denote the beginning of the vector) and ']'
    (to denote the end of the vector). The numbers we place between the brackets are the vector elements. For a row vector the
    element can be separated either by spaces or by commas.

    >> t = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8];
    >> k = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8];

    Row vectors t and k are identical. Let's try to make a row vector
  question: Define a row vector 'm' with 8 random elements
  type: commands
  preeval: [clear('m')]
  evaluation: ['exist(''m'',''var'')', 'size(m)==[1,8]']
  posteval: [clear('m')]
Question_col_vector:
  background: |
    To define column vectors, the syntax is very similar. Instead of using spaces or commas, you
    need to use semicolons (;) to separate the elements.

    >> c = [1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8];

    This results in a vector that looks like this:
    c=[1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8]
    Do you think you are ready to define your first column element?
  question: Define a column vector 'p' with exactly 6 elements
  type: commands
  preeval: [clear('p')]
  evaluation: ['exist(''p'',''var'')', 'size(p)==[6,1]']
  posteval: [clear('p')]
Question_sequences:
    background: |
      Sometimes, we need several sequences of numbers for our MATLAB programs. When you need a very
      big sequence of numbers, it is unpractical to type all the numbers by hand. Luckily MATLAB has
      a quick way to generate them, using the colon symbol (:)
      You can create a sequence of integers by specifying the first and last integer, separated by a
      colon

      >> 1:20
      ans =
        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

      By default, the sequence is created by incrementing by 1, but different increments can be chosen.
      Simply sandwich the increment that you want between the first and last value, and separate by a colon.

      >> 0:5:20
      ans =
        0 5 10 15 20

      You can also use a decimal or a negative number as an increment!
      Go ahead and try it!
    question: Define a row vector 'b' with numbers from 4 until 52 with an increment of 8
    type: commands
    preeval: [clear('b')]
    evaluation: ['exist(''b'',''var'')','b==4:8:52']
    posteval: [clear('b')]
Question_operations:
    background: |
      Creating vectors and sequences are not all that we want to do in MATLAB. We need to operate on them.
      You can do several things with vectors, such as add values to them. As in mathematics, if we add
      a value to a vector, this value is actually added on each of the elements.
      Let's assume we have the vector b you just created
      >> b=4:8:52
      ans =
        b = 4 12 20 28 36 44 52

      We can add the value 5 on the vector, as simple as this:
      >> c=b+2
      ans
        c = 9 17 25 33 41 49 57

      We can also add two vectors together, but only if they are the same dimensions (same length and both row or colomn vectors)
      >> a=b+c
      ans
        a = 13 29 45 61 77 93
    question: |
      Write the command to calculate the difference between vectors
      'c' and 'b' from the previous example and store it in variable 'a'
    type: commands
    preeval: ['b=4:8:52','c=b+5', 'clear(''a'')']
    evaluation: ['exist(''a'',''var'')','isequal(a,[5 5 5 5 5 5 5])']
    posteval: ['clear(''b'',''c'',''a'')']
Questions_line_commands:
    background: |
      Sometimes, it is useful to execute multiple commands writen on the same line. To
      do that, write all the commands on the same line and separate them with a semicolon (;).

      >> a = [1 2 3]; b [4 5 6]; c=b-a;

      This series of commands execute one after the other, therefore variables defined at the
      beginning of the line can be used for operations later on the same line
    question: |
      Create two row vectors ('a' and 'b') with elements '5 6 7' and 
      '8 9 10' respectively and save their sum into a vector 'c'. 
      Do this in one line
    type: commands
    preeval: ['clear(''a'',''b'',''c'')']
    evaluation: ['isequal(a,[5 6 7])','isequal(b,[8 9 10])','isequal(c,a+b)']
    posteval: ['clear(''a'',''b'',''c'')']
Question_powers:
    background: |
      MATLAB allows us to perform several operataions on numbers and matrices. Here's a list of possible operations
      Considering a scalar (number) 's', a row vector 'r' and a column vector 'c', we can:

      Add a scalar to a vector
      >> qa = r+s
      >> wa = c+s
      Multiply a vector by a scalar
      >> qm = r*s
      >> wm = c*s
      Raise a number to a power (e.g. square)
      >> ss = s^2
      Find the square root of a number
      >> sr = sqrt(s)
      Transpose a vector
      >> ct = c' # from column to row
      >> rt = r' # from row to column

      You have to be careful, as all operation must be defined mathematicall (e.g. you cannot raise a row vector to a power)
    question: |
      Define a row vector 'a' with elements [1 2 3]. 
      Define another vector 'b', which has the following form:
      'a' plus 10, and everything is multiplied by 2.
    type: commands
    preeval: ['clear(''a'')','clear(''b'')']
    evaluation: ['exist(''a'',''var'')','exist(''b'',''var'')','isequal(a,[1 2 3])','isequal(b,[22 24 26])']
    posteval: ['clear(''a'')','clear(''b'')']
Question_vector_manipulation:
    background: |
      Beside the previously mentioned operations, it is possible to perform several vector manipulations,
      without doing any unnecesary looping. Matlab is optimized for these kind of operations,
      and will perform much faster than with several iterations. 
      Fo instance you have the vector :
      >> a = [23 42 45 7 9 4 43];
      You can select the 2nd, 5th and 6th elements in the following way:
      >> a([2 5 6])
      ans =
      42     9     4

      Also if you want to access the last element from a vector you can use the keyword: "end"
      For example:
      >> a(end)
      ans =
      43

      In order to define the selection of several elements a vector can be used:
      to every third element from a vector you can use:
      >> a(1:3:end)
      ans =
      23     7    43
    question: |
      Define a row vector 'a' with elements from 1 to 77, with increment 2.
      Select every 5th element from vector 'a', starting from the first one, 
      and save them in vector 'b'. (Hint: Read background!)
    type: commands
    preeval: ['clear(''a'')','clear(''b'')']
    evaluation: ['exist(''a'',''var'')','exist(''b'',''var'')','isequal(a,[1:2:77])','isequal(b,a([1:5:end]))']
    posteval: ['clear(''a'')','clear(''b'')']
Question_dimensions:
    background: |
      Besides defining vectors in one dimension, it is possible to define matrices in multiple dimensions.
      To do that, we use a combination of the notation for row and column vectors. To define a two dimensional
      matrix 'b' we use the following syntax

      >> b = [1 3 4 5;5 6 7 10];

      This command will create a two dimensional matrix with 2 rows and four columns. You can inspect the size
      of a matrix or vector using the 'size' command

      >> size(b)
      ans =
        2   4
      The first number corresponds to the length of the first dimension (rows) and the second to the second dimension (columns)

      We can also retrieve specific elements of a matrix using 'indeces'. For a two dimensional matrix, we need
      to specify which row and which column does the element reside. Using our previously defined matrix b, we can
      request the element of the second row and third column like this:

      >> b(2,3)

      Remember that we first need to define the row and then the column
    question: |
      Define a two dimensional matrix 'b' with 4 rows and 3 columns
      with elements from 1 until 12, filled by column!!!
      Then save the element in 3rd row and 2nd column in a variable 'c'
    type: commands
    preeval: ['clear(''b'',''c'')']
    evaluation: ['exist(''b'',''var'')','exist(''c'',''var'')','isequal(b,[1 5 9;2 6 10;3 7 11;4 8 12])','isequal(c,7)']
    posteval: ['clear(''b'',''c'')']
Question_element_wise:
    background: |
      When working with matrices, sometimes we want to operate on the matrix as a whole, and sometimes we want to
      operate on each of the elements of the matrix. A good example is the square operation of an matrix. By definition
      squaring of an matrix means that we multiply it by itself. However, that is only possible for square matrices.

      Consider a matrix H with MxM dimensions. To calcuate its square, we could raise the matrix to the power of two
      >> H = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9];
      >> HH = H^2 # This implies that we perform the following operation HH = H*H
      HH =
        30 36 42
        66 81 96
        102 126 150

      If we however want to calculate the square of each element of the matrix (element-wise) operation, we need a slightly different syntax

      >> HH = H.^2 # Pay attention to the dot. This will square each element of the matrix.
      HH =
        1  4  9
        16 25 36
        49 64 81

      We can use the '.' notation for other operations besides raising to a power, such as division.
    question: |
      Define H as a 3x3 matrix such as the H in the example
      and a second 3x3 matrix M as the transpose of H.
      Calculate the element-wise division of H by M and save it in matrix D. 
      (In one line)
    type: commands
    preeval: ['clear(''H'',''M'',''D'',''h'',''m'')','h=[1 2 3;4 5 6;7 8 9]','m=h']
    evaluation: ['exist(''H'',''var'')','exist(''M'',''var'')','isequal(D,h./m)||isequal(D,H./M)']
    posteval: ['clear(''H'',''M'',''h'',''m'')']
Question_builtin_functions:
    background: |
      To avoid having to write a lot of complicated operations with vectors and matrices,
      MATLAB has a lot of builtin standard functions and constants that can be used to simplify things.
      Almost all trigonometric functions are available as builtin functions, such as the function of
      sine and cosine (sin(x) and cos(x) respectively). To use such a function, simply call the function
      by its name and insert a number as an argument. For example, to save the cosine of 45 degrees
      in a variable 'a' we can type this in the MATLAB command line:

      >> a = cos(pi/4)

      Notice that we need to provide the angle in radians. That is why we use the builtin constant 'pi'.
      You can also notice that we can do operations inside the brakets (division in this case), or we could
      even insert other functions as well.

      >> b = sin(asin(pi/4))

      In this case, we are calculating first the arcsine of pi/4 radians (45 degrees) and then we calculate
      the sine of this result.

      MATLAB has a very extensive library of builtin functions, which depends on which toolboxes are installed
      on your system. To know which functions exist is a matter of experience. If you want to know how
      to use a specific function, you can always use the 'help' command, followed by the name of the function

      >> help sin #Provides help on how to use the sin function
    question: |
      Calculate the result of the sine of 45 degrees divided by the cosine of 45 degrees.
      Then calculate the arctan of the result and store it in variable 'h'. 
      (Hint: Use pi/4 for 45 degrees)
    type: commands
    preeval: ['clear h']
    evaluation: ['exist(''h'',''var'')','h==pi/4']
    posteval: ['clear h']
Question_polynomials:
    background: |
      In MATLAB, a polynomial is represented by a vector. To create a polynomial in MATLAB, the coefficients
      of the polynomial should be entered in descending order as elements of a vector. For instance, to enter
      the following polynomial:

      p(s) = s^4 + 3*s^3 + 15*s^2 - 2*s + 9

      you need to enter the vector in this manner:

      >> p = [1 3 -15 -2 9]

      Remember that zero coefficients need to be entered as well (by placing a zero in the respective elements).

      Then MATLAB has builtin functions to operate on polynomials defined like this

      - roots(p)             Roots of polynomial p
      - polyval(p,value)     Value of polynomial p at value
      - conv(p,q)            Polynomial multiplication
      - deconv(p,q)          Polynomial division
    question: |
      Define the following polynomial in variable 'p'. 
      Find the value for the polynomial at p(2) and store the result in variable 'v'
        p(s) = s^8 + 5s^5 - 3s^2 + 10
    type: commands
    preeval: ['clear(''p'',''c'')']
    evaluation: ['exist(''p'',''var'')','exist(''v'',''var'')','isequal(p,[1 0 0 5 0 0 -3 0 10])','isequal(v,polyval(p,2))']
    posteval: ['clear(''p'',''c'')']
Question_scripts:
    background: |
      When performing multiple operations in several variables, it is sometimes useful if we can
      save the commands in order to execute them multiple times. This is simply done by creating
      'scripts'. To create a script, click on 'New' and then 'Script'. You will see the editor appearing.
      You can now type multiple commands that will be executed sequentiatlly. You will need to save the script
      before executing it, by clicking on the 'Save' button.

      To execute the script, type the name of the script in the command line and press enter.
    question: |
      Write a script with filename 'script.m' that performs the following operations
      - Defines an matrix 'a' with elements [1 2 3 4;5 6 7 8]
      - Defines a row vector 'b' as a sequence from 1 to 100 with increment 2
      - Stores the element-wise squaring of matrix 'a' into a matrix 'c'

      Press enter when the script is ready.
    type: commands
    preeval: ['clear(''a'',''b'',''c'')','rehash','if exist(''script.m'',''file''); script; end']
    evaluation: ['exist(''a'',''var'')','exist(''b'',''var'')','exist(''c'',''var'')','isequal(a,[1 2 3 4;5 6 7 8])','isequal(b,1:2:100)','isequal(c,a.^2)']
    posteval: ['clear(''a'',''b'',''c'')']
Question_user_functions:
    background: |
      Besides builtin functions, we can also create our own functions in MATLAB. This is similar to
      creating scripts, but all the commands defined must be surrounded by a 'function' statement.
      The use of functions allows us to avoid duplication of code by grouping operations that are
      performed very frequently. Here's how a simple function for adding two numbers is defined

        function [c,d] = addition_subtraction(a,b)
          c = a+b;
          d = a-b;
        end

      Each function can have multiple input and output arguments. The input arguments are defined on the right
      side of the function name inside a braket and are separated by a comma. The output arguments are defined
      on the left side of the function name inside square brackets and are separated by a comma.

      We can save this function in a file to keep things cleaner. The name of the file must match the
      name of the function.

      Later on, we can call the function with any arguments we want and retrieve the results

      >> addition_subtraction(4,2)
      ans =
        6  2
    question: |
      Define a function 'my_multip' in a file with the same name. The function should take two
      arguments (numbers) and it should return one output with the result of the
      multiplication between the two numbers.
      Press enter when the file is ready
    type: commands
    preeval: ['rehash','s=functions(@my_multip)']
    evaluation: ['~isempty(s.file)','nargin(@my_multip)==2','my_multip(2,8)==16','my_multip(9,4)==36']
    posteval: ['clear(''s'')']
Question_constants:
    background: |

      Some constants in MATLAB have a less straighforward syntax. For instance if you want to use the e number,
      you have to use the function exp(x), which will return the e^x.

      You can use all of these already existing constants and functions inside of your own function.
      Remember! If you are not sure about how a certain function works is it a good practice to use the help.

    question: |
      Create a function with name 'my_exp' which has two input arguments, for instance 'a' and 'b'.
      The function output is: 'e' at the power of ('a' at the power of 'b') multiplied with pi.
      Where 'e' is the Euler's number.
      Press enter when ready
    type: commands
    evaluation: ['~isempty(s.file)','nargin(@my_exp)==2','my_exp(2,4)==exp(2^4)*pi']
    preeval: ['rehash','s=functions(@my_exp)']
    posteval: ['clear(''s'')']
Question_plotting:
    background: |
      Plotting is a very good way to inspect a function or some results by visualising them and observing any existing trends.
      The most simple way to plot data is using a 2 dimensional (2D) plot, which plots a vector (e.g. x) against another vector (e.g. y)
      To do this, we simple use the 'plot' function and specifying the vectors that we want to use for plotting:

      >> plot(x,y)

      The vectors x and y should have been previously defined and they should have the same size (i.e. dimensions and lengths)

      A good example of visualisation is visualising the sine as a function of time. To do that, we first need to create a 't' vector representing the time
      and then calculate the sine for the specific values of time.

      >> t=0:0.25:7; y=sin(t); plot(t,y)

      Basic plotting is very easy in Matlab, and the plot command has extensive add-on capabilities. These capabilities include many functions such as:

      grid: Toggles a grid on and off the current figure
      axis: Controls axis scaling and appearance
      title('text'): Adds 'text' at the top of the current axis
      xlabel('text'): Labels the x-axis with 'text'
      ylabel('text'): Labels the y-axis with 'text'
      subplot: Creates axes in tiled positions
    question: |
      Plot the line with function y=2*x+10 for x starting from 0 until 100 (in one line)
    type: commands
    preeval: ['x=0:100','y=2*x+10','h=figure','set(h,''Name'',''Correct plot'',''Position'',[0 200 560 420])','k=axes','plot(k,x,y)','g=figure','set(g,''Name'',''Your plot'',''Position'',[600 200 560 420])']
    evaluation: ['strcmp(questdlg(''Are the two figures the same?'',''Yes'',''No''),''Yes'')']
    posteval: ['close all']
Question_mesh:
    background: |
      Plotting in 3D is even more fun and useful. Consider the function f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2
      To graphically represent this function, first the values of x and y have to be defined using 'meshgrid'

      >> [x,y] = meshgrid(-1:.01:1);

      This command creates a grid of values for x and y, ranging from -1 to 1 with an increment of 0.01.
      The range or increment can also be different for the two variables

      >> [x,y] = meshgrid(-1:.01:1,-2:.01:2);

      For plotting the graphical representation of the function at the points x,y we use the mesh command

      >> mesh(x,y,x.^2+y.^2);

      The value of the function is computed and plotted for each point on the grid. The z value and the colour
      of the plot is related to the resulting value of the function for each point.

    question: |
      Create a script with filename 'mesh_script' that does the following
      - Creates a mesh grid for x and y between -pi and pi with increment of 0.01.
      - Plot the 3D graphical representation of the function sine(x) + cosine(y) - sine(y)

      Press enter when the script is ready
    type: commands
    preeval: ['[xi,yi]=meshgrid(-pi:0.01:pi)','h=figure','set(h,''Name'',''Correct plot'',''Position'',[0 200 560 420])','k=axes','mesh(k,xi,yi,sin(xi)+cos(yi)-sin(yi))','g=figure','set(g,''Name'',''Your plot'',''Position'',[600 200 560 420])','rehash','if exist(''mesh_script.m'',''file''); mesh_script; end']
    evaluation: ['strcmp(questdlg(''Are the two figures the same?'',''Yes'',''No''),''Yes'')']
    posteval: ['close all']
Question_contour:
    background: |
      Sometimes, using a 2D representation of such functions can also be useful, specifically when plotting
      the projection on the XY plane. To do this, we can use the 'contour' function the same way as the 'mesh' function

      >> [x,y] = meshgrid(-1:.01:1,-2:.01:2);
      >> contour(x,y,x.^2+y.^2);
    question: |
      Create a script with filename 'contour_script' that does the following
      - Creates a mesh grid for x and y between -pi and pi with increment of 0.01
      - Plot the 2D contour graphical representation of the function sine(x) + cosine(y) - sine(y)

      Press enter when the script is ready
    type: commands
    preeval: ['[xi,yi]=meshgrid(-pi:0.01:pi)','h=figure','set(h,''Name'',''Correct plot'',''Position'',[0 200 560 420])','k=axes','contour(k,xi,yi,sin(xi)+cos(yi)-sin(yi))','g=figure','set(g,''Name'',''Your plot'',''Position'',[600 200 560 420])','rehash','if exist(''contour_script.m'',''file''); contour_script; end']
    evaluation: ['strcmp(questdlg(''Are the two figures the same?'',''Yes'',''No''),''Yes'')']
    posteval: ['close all']
Question_structures:

      After working a lot in matlab, you will realise that, it is not a good practice to create separate
      variables for each parameter. A much better option is to use STRUCTURES, which are very easy to create here.

      A structure is a collection of variables that don't have to be of the same type. Each variable is stored in separete
      fields, and each field can be of any type.

      For instance, you can have a ''fruit'' structure, and it can have fields such as ''name'', ''colour'' and ''weight''.
      The name and colour fields should probably be strings, but the weight field would be better represented by a double.

      To define a structure with fields, we use the dot syntax as following:

      >> fruit.name = 'orange';
      >> fruit.colour = 'orange';
      >> fruit.weight = 1; # In kg

      To access the content of a field, we use again the same syntax

      >> fruit.name

      ans =
        orange

      A field can be a structure by itself, with additional subfields

      >> fruit.colour.skin = 'orange';
      >> fruit.colour.leaves = 'green';

      Finally, we can also create an array type struct and store multiple elements with the same fields

      >> fruit(2).name = 'apple';
      >> fruit(2).colour.skin = 'red';
      >> fruit(2).colour.leaves = 'green';
      >> fruit(2).weight = 0.5;
      >> fruit(2)

      ans =

        name: 'apple'
        colour: [1x1 struct]
        weight: 1

      >> fruit(2).colour
      ans =

        skin: 'red'
        leaves: 'green'

    question: |
      Create a 'my_self' structure, which contains 3 fields:
      name - your name (as a string)
      sex - your sex (as a string)
      age - your age (as a double)

      Hint: you have to do everyting in one line :)
    type: commands
    evaluation: [ 'exist(''my_self'')','isfield(my_self,''name'')','isfield(my_self,''sex'')','isfield(my_self,''age'')','strcmp(class(my_self.name),''char'')','strcmp(class(my_self.sex),''char'')','strcmp(class(my_self.age),''double'')']
    preeval: ['clear(''my_self'')']
    posteval: ['clear(''my_self'')']
Question_symbolic:
    background: |
      The Symbolix Math toolbox allows one to work with symbolic variables. A symbolic variable 'x'
      is defined as

      >> syms x

      Standard MATLAB operations and functions can be used on symbolic variables, and the returned result
      will be symbolic as well (i.e. a generic variable that can be used without values). Symbolic variables
      can be combined to create more complicated structures, such as symbolic functions

      >> syms x y z
      >> f = x+y;
      >> g = 2*y+z;
      >> h = f*g
        h =
          (x+y)*(2*y+z)

      To evaluate a symbolic variable for a given set of values, you can use the 'subs' function (for one variable)

      >> subs(f,x,1)
      ans =
          y+1;
    question: Define a symbolic function f with symbolic variables x and y as f=x^2+3*y.
    type: commands
    preeval: ['clear(''f'',''x'',''y'')']
    evaluation: ['isa(x,''sym'')','isa(y,''sym'')','isa(f,''sym'')','isequal(f,x^2+3*y)||isequal(f(x,y),x^2+3*y)']
    posteval: ['clear(''f'',''x'',''y'')']
Question_sym_diff:
    background: |
      Symbolic functions can be differentiated or integrated, using diff or int respectively. In general
      symbolic operations (such as diff or int) must be performed before any evaluation of variables.
      We can differentiate with respect to a single variable like this

      >> syms x y z;
      >> h = (x+y)*(2*y+z);
      >> diff(h,x)       #Differentiation with respect to x
      ans =
        2*y+z
      >> diff(diff(h,x),y)       #Differentiation with respect to x and then to y
      ans =
        2

      Or we can differentiate with respect to all the variables (i.e. Jacobian)
      >> g = jacobian(h)
      g =
        [2*y+z, 4*y+z+2*x, x+y]

      One can also solve symbolic equations

      >> syms x
      >> sol = solve('x^2+3*x=2')         # Second order polynomial equation
      sol =
        -3/2+1/2*17^(1/2)
        -3/2-1/2*17^(1/2)

      Or even systems of equations

      >> syms x y
      >> sol = solve('x^2+3*x=2','x+y=3')
      sol.x =
        -3/2+1/2*17^(1/2)
        -3/2-1/2*17^(1/2)
      sol.y =
        9/2-1/2*17^(1/2)
        9/2+1/2*17^(1/2)

      The results are treated as symbolic variables and to obtain the exact value, they must be evaluated
    question: |
      Define a symbolic expression f as f=x^2+y^3+2xy 
      and save in variable g the jacobian of f
    type: commands
    preeval: ['clear(''f'',''x'',''y'',''g'')','syms x y','fi = x^2+y^3+2*x*y']
    evaluation: ['exist(''f'',''var'')','exist(''g'',''var'')','exist(''x'',''var'')','exist(''y'',''var'')','isequal(f,fi)','isequal(g,jacobian(f))']
    posteval: ['clear(''f'',''x'',''y'',''g'')']
Question_conditions:
    background: |
      At this point you should be already familiar with the variable declaration, in several ways.
      As in other programming languages, in MATLAB we can also write loops and logical statements.
      The 'if' statement has the following form:

        if (condition)
            statement, variable etc.
        else
            statement, variable etc.
        end

      'while':
        while (condition)
            statement, variable etc.
        end

      The 'for' loop is a little bit different from other programming languages
        for  var= expression
            statement, variable etc.
        end

      For example the expression can be i=1:10 or i=1:2:10 etc.
    question: |
      Create a function, with name 'my_stat' which has two input arguments, 'x', 'y'.
      In the function you have to check if the input 'x' is a vector or a scalar.
      If scalar:
          iterate the following equation 10 times: a = a +(x^i)*y+ y/x; where a=0, i=1; before the iteration;
          The output is 'a'
      If vector:
          insert the scalar 'y' into the vector 'x'
          sort the vector 'x' in ascending order
          the output is a sorted ROW
    type: commands
    evaluation: ['~isempty(s.file)','nargin(@my_stat)==2','my_stat(2,4)==8204', 'my_stat([1 3 2],4)== [1 2 3 4]' ]
    preeval: ['rehash','s=functions(@my_stat)']
    posteval: ['clear(''s'')']
