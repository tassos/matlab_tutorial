Question1:
  background: Variables are very useful in Matlab. They hold values that can be passed as arguments in functions
  question: Define a variable "a" with the value "1"
  type: string
  evaluation: [a=1, a = 1, a =1, a= 1]
  preeval: []
  posteval: [clear('a')]
Question2:
  background: More about variables
  question: Ready for a challenge? Define "b" equal to "1"!
  type: commands
  evaluation: ['exist(''b'',''var'')', b==1]
  preeval: []
  posteval: [clear('b')]
Question3:
  background: |
    In case the background is very lengthy,
    this is how you define multiple lines in the field
    (yeah, you just add a pipe '|' and then indent the following lines.
    Each line will appear as a line in the tutorial as well.
  question: What do you think? Will it work?
  type: string
  evaluation: ['yes','yes!','definitely!!']
  preeval: []
  posteval: [spy]
